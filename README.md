# Predictive Insights in Real Estate: Advanced Modeling Strategies for Accurate Price Forecasting

# Overview of Dataset

This dataset has been sourced from magicbricks.com. It offers a comprehensive compilation of real estate details, encompassing numerous variables related to residential properties. It provides insights into property characteristics like (area, latitude, longitude, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Balcony, Status, neworold parking, Furnished_status, Lift, Landmarks, type_of_building, desc, and Price_sqft). With a wealth of information, the dataset facilitates an in-depth exploration of the relationships between these variables and the ultimate sale price (Price) of the properties. This dataset can be utilised as a valuable tool for constructing a predictive model, and enhancing decision-making for various stakeholders in the real estate market, including homebuyers, sellers, and industry professionals.

# Problem Statement/ Objective of the Project

The primary goal of using the real estate dataset is to construct a robust predictive model for housing prices (Price), considering a variety of features. The challenge encompasses unravelling intricate relationships among predictors like property characteristics. The task involves crafting and optimizing a machine-learning model that comprehensively captures the complexities of the real estate market and an interactive dashboard for insightful visualization. This model aims to serve as a valuable tool for stakeholders, including homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals, enabling them to make well-informed decisions based on accurate predictions of property values.

# Steps to Approach the Problem

__1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:__ Review the dataset structure and column types, and apply data cleaning and appropriate data manipulation techniques.

__2. Create Visualisations:__ Create visualisations to understand feature distributions and generate correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables. Additionally, create new features to capture temporal dynamics.

__3. Model Training with Regularisation:__ Train the forecasting model incorporating basic as well as Ridge and Lasso regression techniques.

__4. Hyperparameter Tuning for Regularisation:__ Fine-tune the regularisation parameters for Ridge and Lasso regression. Explore a range of alpha values to find the optimal level of regularisation. Understand the impact of regularisation on model coefficients and its role in preventing model complexity.

__5. Comparison with Non-Regularized Models:__ Compare the performance of Ridge and Lasso regression with basic regression. Assess improvements in terms of generalisation and reduction of overfitting.

__6. Bias-Variance Trade-off Analysis:__ Find the optimal model complexity that minimises both bias and variance to achieve a well-balanced predictive performance.

__7. Model Testing and Evaluation:__ Test and evaluate the models to ensure their effectiveness. Evaluate how regularisation affects the modelâ€™s performance.

__8. Geometric representation:__ Gain a visual insight into how Ridge and Lasso regularisation shapes the coefficient space, aiding in the comprehension of their impact on model parameters.
